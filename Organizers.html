                <h2>About the Project (Pt.2)</h2>
                <p>These boxes were possible due to generous donations, as well as dedicated volunteers. We worked day after day for months thinking about every minute detail and planning for every possible disaster. These people were extremely helpful and definitely indispensible in the planning and creation of this project. Please read more about them below.</p>

                        <h2>About the Organizers</h2>
                        <p>The people that organized this project were the true heroes behind the curtain. A special thanks to Mr. Hart from Granada High School for being so helpful in being a beneficiary representative. Also, I'd like to thank Mr. Walton and Mrs. Berg for helping me with the hardest part of this project: the paperwork.</p>
