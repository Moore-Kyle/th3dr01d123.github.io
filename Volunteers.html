                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>In this project, myself and my amazing team of volunteers built ADA-approved garden boxes. The purpose of these boxes is for wheelchair-bound students at Granada High School to be able to access the boxes without needing to get out of their chairs.</p>

                    <h2>About the Volunteers and Donors</h2>
                    <p>The volunteers and donors are the real heroes of this project. Without them none of this would've been done. I asked for donations via email and letters, with a goal of raising $500. With the donors' outstanding help, we were able to raise almost $1,200! The volunteers worked tirelessly for 2 days, clearing huge piles of dirt and assembling the boxes with great efficiency.</p>
